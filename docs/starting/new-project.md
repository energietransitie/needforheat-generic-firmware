# Use the library in a new project

The easiest way to start a new project for the firmware of your specific measurement device is use the GitHub template [NeedForHeat Presence detector](https://github.com/energietransitie/needforheat-presence-detector), save it to a suitable location and start adding your own code and documentation. This template includes all boilerplate code and configuration files you need.
