# Twomes provisioning overview

Twomes provisioning is the process that involves:
- In a more broad sense:
    - subject account creation
    - app installation & account activation
    - [device preparation](../deploying/device_preparation.md) 
- In a more narrow sense:
    - [device installation](../documenting/installation_manual.md)
    - Wi-Fi provisioning
    - device-app activation
    - device-backend activation  

 In a separate pdf document, we provide an [overview of twomes provisioning and the steps and roles played by a Twomes measurement device, app, and API](https://github.com/energietransitie/twomes-backoffice-api/blob/main/docs/twomes-provisioning.pdf).

> For a future version of  the [twomes-backoffice-api](https://github.com/energietransitie/twomes-backoffice-api/) repository, we consider migrating this seperate pdf document to MkDocs pages like these. Feel free to make a fork and Pull Request for this!
