# Use the library in a new project

The easiest way to start a new project for the firmware of your specific measurement device is to copy the contents of [presence detector example folder](https://github.com/energietransitie/twomes-generic-esp-firmware/tree/main/examples/presence_detector) to the root folder of a new development project. This folder includes all boilerplate code and configuration files you need.
