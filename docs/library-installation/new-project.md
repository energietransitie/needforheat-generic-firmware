# Create a new project

## Copy an example from the repository

The easiest method of creating a new project is to copy an existing example from the respository to use as a starting point, because it includes the boilerplate code and configuration files.

We recommend to use the [presence detector example](https://github.com/energietransitie/twomes-generic-esp-firmware/tree/main/examples/presence_detector).
